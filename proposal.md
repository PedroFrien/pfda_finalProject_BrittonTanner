# Connect 4 

## Repository Link:

https://github.com/PedroFrien/pfda_finalProject_BrittonTanner

## Description:

This project will be a simple Connect 4 game in which the player can either play against another player(taking turns on the same device) or a simple ai that will make random moves. It will use pygame and the visual skills we have learned to have the Connect 4 discs color coded and to have atleast some sort of visual displayed.

## Features:

### Functioning connect 4 game - I imagine this will use arrays/lists and also most importantly classes(such as the classes used to create the raindrops in our final lab).

### Visuals - This will be through the use of pygame similar to our raindrop lab to communicate a visual to the player.

### AI opponent - This feature will probably just be an option to face an AI opponent that just drops discs in random spots with no rhyme or reason which would be simple enough through the use of random.randrange, but maybe I could have some way where the disc classes could recognize when an empty space next to them results in victory and communicate that to the AI code...

## Challenges

I will need to learn more about arrays and lists. I will also need to refresh myself on how to create visuals in pygame, as well as how to create classes. Finally, I will need to learn how I can use the disc classes to recognize when a 4-in-a-row has been reached. This will likely be the hardest part, but I am confident that I can find some documentation that will teach me how this mechanic can work.

## Outcomes

### Ideal Outcome - My ideal outcome is a simple connect 4 game that is represented with simple visuals(and perhaps even a falling animation when you place a disc) where a player can either take turns with another player on the same device or play against a simple AI opponent. 

### Minimal Viable Outcome - The minimum viable outcome of this project would be a connect 4 game where you would take turns against another player, but in a text-based environment instead of through pygame visuals and without an AI opponent. 

## Milestones

### Week 1 - GitHub file set up

### Week 2 - Game Functionality Created

### Week 3 - Visuals Added

### Week 4 - Simple AI opponent created
